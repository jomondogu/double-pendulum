# Double Pendulum - Assignment 3, CSC 473, Fall 2018

Models double pendulum using Lagrangian constraints

* Based on lab code available at https://github.com/marovira/csc473_fall2018_labs/tree/master/labs/labs/lab05/source
* Acceleration in theta 1 & theta 2 modeled after Lagrangian constraint formulae from http://www.physicsandbox.com/projects/double-pendulum.html
* overwrite contents of ./labs
* run with "./labs/double_pendulum/double_pendulum"
